  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  As a developer, I want a quick professional Readme.md Generator for Github projects. The readme.md is the key to the infrastructure of the application. It provides the user, developer and client the concept of the application, design, functionality and key information - like a whitepaper without the detailed diagnostic.
