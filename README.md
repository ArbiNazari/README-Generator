  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
    As a developer, I want a quick professional Readme.md Generator for Github
    posted projects.

    The Readme.md is the key to the infrastructure of the applications. It provides the 
    user, developer and client the concept of the application, design, functionality,
    purpose and key information - like a whitepaper without the detailed diagnostic. 

    Application Requirements and My Task:

   - The generator must have a command-line and input.
   - User is prompted for information about their application respistory in order
     for a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project 
     and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, 
     Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
   - User enters "Project Title", use is then displayed with a title of the README.md
   - Information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, 
     Usage, Contributing, and Tests when user enters description, installation instructions, 
     usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions.
   - Licensing - user chooses licenses from a list of option. Then a badge for that license 
     is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README 
     entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
   - Github - user enters Github username and this is added to the section of the README
     entitled "Questions", with a link to their Github profile.
   - Email address - uwder must insert their email address which is added to the section
     entitled "Questions", with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
   - Table of Contents - must correspondence with the sceiot of the README.
